# Frontend Assessment

This task aims to assess your knowledge in dealing with APIs. The following API returns a
list of example users: https://randomuser.me/api/?results=20

## Tasks

+ **Task 1**: Pull the data from this API and log it to the console.
+ **Task 2**: Print this JSON to the screen. And add a button, which allows you to refresh the
  data.
+ **Task 3**: Now I'd like to assess your ability to turn this JSON data into something usable.
  Take the Users' name, email, username and password and display the data in a table.
+ **Task 4**: Just a quick test on your ability to handle images. Add another column which
  displays the medium-sized image of the user.
